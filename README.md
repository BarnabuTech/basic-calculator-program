# BASIC CALCULATOR PROGRAM

Created a simple Python program that asks the user to input two numbers and a mathematical operation `(addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division)` .
Perform the operation based on the user's input and print the results.

- Example: If a user inputs `10, 5, and +` , your program should display `10 + 5 = 15` .
